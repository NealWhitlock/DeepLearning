Lambda classwork on deep learning with ANN's

The fourth month of Lambda's Data Science track was about artifical neural networks and deep learning. These files are my notes from class and submitted assignments.

The first week was on natural language processing.
Week two was an introduction to neural nets and included work in developing a perceptron from scratch.
Week three was focused on deep learning.
